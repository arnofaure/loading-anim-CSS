# loading-anim-CSS
Playing with CSS (only) to create loading animations.

Here are the previews:

Animation 1:
![Anim1](preview-gif/anim-1.gif)

Animation 2:
![Anim1](preview-gif/anim-2.gif)

Animation 3:
![Anim1](preview-gif/anim-3.gif)


Each animation has its own html file (+ Internal CSS Style Sheet) in the loading folder.
